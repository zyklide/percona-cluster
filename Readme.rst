Percona XtraDB Cluster : Vagrant & pupppet recipes
**************************************************

This Vagrant setup can be used to deploy and test Percona XtraDB Cluster (Percona Server with Galera - http://www.percona.com/software/percona-xtradb-cluster) in 
VirtualBox. 

The puppet code illustrates the latest improvement of PXC since version 5.5.31-23.7.5 
(http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/release-notes/Percona-XtraDB-Cluster-5.5.31-23.7.5.html):

* bootstrap the cluster 
* use extended Xtrabackup features during SST

Puppet recipes can also be used without Vagrant


Requirements
============

You need : 

* a Debian 7 x86_64 box to use with Vagrant. (64 bit is mandatory if you use compression for xtrabackup stream, and you don't want to compile qpress by yourself)
* VirtualBox - https://www.virtualbox.org/
* a working Vagrant environment - http://vagrantup.com/
* an Internet connection for the VM's
 
If you don't have a Debian 7 base box, you can create one: http://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/boxes/base.html

How to use it ?
===============

Once you have your requirements ready, it's very easy to deploy your boxes:: 

   $ git clone https://github.com/zyklide/percona-cluster-debian.git
   $ cd percona-cluster-debian
   $ vagrant up 

This will deploy the 4 machines: percona1, percona2, percona3 and percona4.

And this is all !

These recipes also install GLB (Galera Load Balancer) on percona1.

You can read more on shinguz's post : http://www.fromdual.com/mysql-and-galera-load-balancer

.. note:: Starting MySQL on percona2, percona3 and percona4 takes a lot of time as the sleep delay of the init script has been increased during SST.


Details about the new functionalities
=====================================

bootstrap the cluster
---------------------

Since PXC 5.5.31, it's now possible to bootstrap the cluster (http://www.percona.com/doc/percona-xtradb-cluster/manual/bootstrap.html) using
*bootstrap-pxc* instead of *start* as command for the init script. Read this for more information related on how it had to be done before: 
 http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2013/01/29/how-to-start-a-percona-xtradb-cluster/
 
With this puppet code, we define in *site.pp* the node we want to use to bootstrap the cluster (percona1 in this case)::

   class {
         'percona::cluster':
            bootstrap => True
   }

If you use these puppet recipes in production, I recommend you to set *bootstrap* to **True** only when needed.

SST integration with Xtrabackup 2.1
-----------------------------------

Since PXC 5.5.31 it's alo possible to use the new xbstream options for Xtrabackup.

In the current environment, SST is performed by Xtrabackup in 2 parallel threads and compressed. (It's also possible to crypt it).

To achieve that, some easy additions to my.cnf are needed. So this is what I added in the template (*modules/percona/templates/cluster/my.cnf.erb*)::

   [sst]
   streamfmt=xbstream
   
   [xtrabackup]
   compress
   compact
   parallel=2
   compress-threads=2
   rebuild-threads=2
    
But it is also **mandatory** to have *qpress* (http://www.quicklz.com/) installed and the MySQL datadir must be empty (which is currently very boring, see
https://bugs.launchpad.net/percona-xtrabackup/+bug/1193240).

There are 2 puppet classes performing these actions:

* class qpress 
* class percona::cluster::xbstream 

This is what you should see in mysql's error log if it worked as expected:
::

How to setup the environment
============================

These are the steps to run to be able to setup everything you need.

VirtualBox
----------

::

   # apt-get install virtualbox


Vagrant
-------

::

   # apt-get install vagrant
  
Import the base box
...................

::

   # name your base box as debian7_64.box
   # vagrant box add debian7_64 debian7_64.box   
   # rm debian7_64.box (if you don't need a copy)
